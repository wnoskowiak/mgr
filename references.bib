abstract = {Before the observation of neutrino oscillations, there was no pressing reason to
            consider neutrinos to be massive. While there is still no direct measurement of the
            values of the neutrino masses, the observation of neutrino oscillations has now firmly
            established that the three neutrinos in the Standard Model mix must necessarily have
            different masses. In this chapter, the fundamentals of neutrino oscillations are
            outlined, and the current observational status is briefly discussed.},
